How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The staging area can be used to compare against the Working directory. The working directory contains all the changes.
To add files to the staging area use
git add filename
this adds files to the staging area then perform the 
Git commit 
to save all the changes. 
If you want to remove all changes use the 
git reset —-hard
this will undo all the changes (careful!!! all changes in all files will be reset)


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are helpful when creating new changes but you don’t want to modify the same on the main branch ex: experimental changes.
use 
git branch some_name
to create new branch. To go to this branch use
git checkout some_name
make changes by doing “git add” and “git commit” it gets save to branch some_name

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
the diagrams help to understand the different branches that the user created and the ones that are not merged to the “master” branch. This will be helpful for making experimental changes without affecting the main branch.
