How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The staging area can be used to compare against the Working directory. The working directory contains all the changes.
To add files to the staging area use
git add filename
this adds files to the staging area then perform the 
Git commit 
to save all the changes. 
If you want to remove all changes use the 
git reset â€”-hard
this will undo all the changes (careful!!! all changes in all files will be reset)
